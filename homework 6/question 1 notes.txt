part 1:
For subject '129', the keyframes reflect the movement that is labeled. The legs that 
are in motion are properly labeled and the images are shot from the correct 
angle. All parts of the body are in the shot, thus allowing for correct keypoint
labelling in the future. 

For subject '129', the keypoint annotations also seem to be accurate and high-quality, 
as all parts of the body appear to be consistently and correctly labelled
This is confirmed when we remove the image and only plot the keypoints--by
doing so we see that the keypoints' general shape form what we expect the 
exercise to generally look like. 

For subject '029', the keyframes reflect the movement that is labeled. The images are shot from 
the correct angle but the body parts in motion are not properly labeled. All 
body parts are not in the shot, hence correct keypoint labelling 
may not be possible in future.

For subject '029', the keypoint annotations are not accurate except 
for the reach movement. When we remove the keyframes and only see the keypoints, 
the labelled points look glob-like and nothing like the general form of
the exercise they are supposed to reflect.

For subject '048', the keyframes reflect the movement that is labeled. The legs that 
are in motion are properly labeled and the images are shot from the correct 
angle. All parts of the body are in the shot, thus allowing for correct keypoint
labelling in the future.

For subject '098', the keyframes reflect the movement that is labeled. The legs
that are in motion are properly labeled, but the images are not shot from the 
correct angle. It also appears that there are 2 different subjects represented
in the keyframes. For inline left and right, there appears to be a different
person doing the exercise than the rest of the movements. All parts of the body are in the shot, thus allowing for correct keypoint
labelling in the future.

exercise to generally look like.

For subject '132', the keyframes reflect the movement that is labeled. The legs
that are in motion are properly labeled, and the images are shot from the correct
angle. However, half the exercises are shot in portrait mode as specified, but the 
other half are shot in landscape mode. 

For subject '132', the keypoint annotations seem to be inaccurate for the portrait images and accurate
for the landscape images. For reach, squat, inline, and lunge, the keypoints are not labelled properly and 
plotting the keypoints alone does not give the general form of the exercise. However, they are correctly 
labeled for hamstrings, stretch, deadbug, and pushup. 

For subject '184', the keyframes reflect the movement that is labeled. The legs that 
are in motion are properly labeled and the images are shot from the correct 
angle. All parts of the body are in the shot, thus allowing for correct keypoint
labelling in the future.

part 2:
For squats, the poses appear to be fairly varied. It appears that some students get deeper into the stretch by bending their knees more, while others
emphasize their posterior more. Furthermore, some students raise their arms straight above their head
while others raise their arms up at an angle close to 45 degrees. They keypoints are also inconsistently
labeled, with some correct and others not. Also, the shooting angle appears to be inconsistent. Lighting is also inconsistent, especially
because it appears that some students shot this outside, while others shot in apartments, and finally some students shot in darker indoor areas. 
Frame aspect is fairly stable across subjects, as most look to be standardized to around the specified 30 fps, sans for some outliers with poor quality images. 

I chose to secondly visualize left lunges. A random selection of these poses shows that there is less variation in how students performed this exercise. 
Most students extend their left leg forward and their right leg backward such that the right knee is just above the ground and the left leg is at a close to 90 degree angle. 
Most keypoints are mostly correctly labeled. The shooting angle is inconsistent again, as some students shot at the correct angle/perspective, while others shot close to straight on. Lighting seems to be more standardized, as there
are more students who completed this exercise is well-lit areas indoors. There are still however a few students who completed these exercises in darker indoor areas. 
Frame aspect is fairly stable across subjects, as most look to be standardized to around the specified 30 fps, sans for some outliers with smaller aspect ratios.

When I visualized the last set of 15 random frames of any kind, I see significant variation in lighting, poses, shooting angle, but keypoints appear to mostly be labelled properly. 
Frame aspect is fairly stable across subjects. 

part 3:
for subject '129', it appears that the annotation location is correct across all 
the subject's images, the keypoint colors are correct, and that the number of people detected is 1 (except for pushup where 2 people are detected.)
The bounding box mostly captures the body of the subject, with the exception of pushup where 
the subject's right hand is detected as a second person. 
for the 15 video frames for 'squat', the images appear to be consistently labelled in terms of keypoint annotations and color.
Furthermore, the bounding box appears to capture the subject's body in motion, and correctly identifies 
that only 1 body is present in the frame.

For subject '029', the annotation location is correct across all the subject's
images, they keypoint colors are correct, and the images appear to be consistently labeled. 

For subject '048',  the annotation location is correct across all the subject's
images, they keypoint colors are correct, and the images appear to be consistently labeled. 

For subject '072', the annotation location is correct across all the subject's
images, they keypoint colors are correct, and the images appear to be consistently labeled. 
However, the lighting appears to be inconsistent across this individual's video frames, as in some 
images there is lots of light to the point of discoloration, while other images appear to be muted and somewhat dimly
lit. 

For subject '086', the annotation location is correct across all the subject's
images, they keypoint colors are correct, and the images appear to be consistently labeled. 

For subject '098', the annotation location is correct across all the subject's
images, they keypoint colors are correct, and the images appear to be consistently labeled. 
One thing to note, the subject's images are in two different background settings (location change) and 
the subject is wearing different clothing across the different images, potentially introducing noise into the frame
data. 

For subject '132', the annotation location is correct across all the subject's
images, they keypoint colors are correct, and the images appear to be consistently labeled. 
Two things to note: for hamstrings, stretch, deadbug, and pushup, the video frames appear to be warped at the edges
similar to a fisheye effect compressing the body and background of the subject. Thus, there is new noise
potentially introduced, as the video frames indicate the the size of the subject's limbs has changed across exercises due to the 
frame warping. 
The sampling rate appears to only sometimes capture the movement. The sampling rate of the video frames
does not appear to be uniform, thus capturing the different exercises at different stages, sometimes when the exercises is in progress, other times when the 
exercise is done or before it is performed. 

part d:
The plot of raw neck keypoint exhibits a wide spread, meaning that there is a lot of variation/statistical noise in labeled neck keypoint annotations. There is a cluster of points between 500-1500 on the x and y axes, with signficant numbers of outliers outside of this clustered area.
However, after normalization, there is much less spread/variation/noise. Keypoint coordinates are tightly clustered around 0-1 on the x-axis and around 0 on the y-axis. There are only a few noticeable outliers. It appears that the procrustes analysis normalized our labelled neck keypoint coordinates
well. Different neck shapes and body shapes have been accounted for well with the normalization method, creating a more consistent placement of the neck coordinate labels for our model to learn.
